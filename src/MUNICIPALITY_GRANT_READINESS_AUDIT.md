# Municipality / Grant Readiness Audit Checklist

- ✅ Conflict of interest policy section available
- ✅ Clear role separation: participant / volunteer / staff / board / admin

## Data protection (GDPR)
- ✅ Data protection & GDPR page present

  - Add a privacy policy + cookie policy pages if required by deployment region
  - Add data retention policy and export/delete request procedure

## Accessibility & inclusivity

- ✅ RTL support for Arabic
- Recommended next:

- Recommended next:
  - Add audit trail retention + export versioning metadata
